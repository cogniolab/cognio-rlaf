# RLAF: Building on Open-AgentRL, ARPO, and KAT-Dev - A Unified Framework for Agentic Reinforcement Learning

**The Missing Piece in Multi-Agent AI Systems**

---

## The Problem: Single-Perspective RL is Limiting

Traditional reinforcement learning uses **single scalar rewards**:

```
reward = 0.75
```

But what does 0.75 mean? Is the response:
- ‚úÖ Factually correct but slow?
- ‚úÖ Fast but policy non-compliant?
- ‚úÖ Technically perfect but user-unfriendly?

**We can't tell.** Single rewards lack context.

## The Solution: Multi-Perspective Critic Ensembles

Enter **RLAF (Reinforcement Learning from Agentic Feedback)**:

```python
feedbacks = [
    Feedback(critic="accuracy", score=0.9, reasoning="Correct answer"),
    Feedback(critic="policy", score=0.6, reasoning="SLA risk"),
    Feedback(critic="speed", score=0.8, reasoning="Could be faster"),
]
# Aggregated reward: 0.77 with rich diagnostic context
```

Instead of one critic, **RLAF uses multiple specialized critics**, each evaluating from a different perspective.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

RLAF isn't built in a vacuum. It combines innovations from three major 2025 breakthroughs:

### 1. ARPO (July 2025)
**Adaptive Reinforcement Policy Optimization** - [arXiv:2507.19849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19849)

**Key Innovation:** Entropy-based adaptive rollout
- High uncertainty ‚Üí more exploration
- Dynamically adjusts batch size and learning rate
- RLAF Implementation: We use multi-critic disagreement as entropy signal

### 2. Open-AgentRL (October 13, 2025)
**GRPO-TCR: Tool-Call Reasoning** - [Gen-Verse](https://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL)

**Key Innovation:** Deliberative reasoning before tool calls
- 4B model outperforms 32B models
- Selective tool use (avoids over-calling)
- SOTA on AIME, GPQA, LiveCodeBench
- RLAF Implementation: We add tool-use critic to the ensemble

### 3. KAT-Dev (September 2025)
**Multi-Stage Agentic Training** - [Skywork AI](https://skywork.ai/blog/agentic-reinforcement-learning-code-generation/)

**Key Innovation:** 3-stage training pipeline
- Mid-training ‚Üí RFT ‚Üí Agentic RL
- 62.4% on SWE-Bench Verified
- RLAF Implementation: We support multi-stage configs

---

## RLAF's Unique Contribution

While ARPO, Open-AgentRL, and KAT-Dev focus on **algorithms** and **orchestration**, RLAF focuses on **feedback architecture**:

### üé≠ Multi-Perspective Evaluation

```python
critics = CriticEnsemble([
    CriticAgent("accuracy-critic", "accuracy"),
    CriticAgent("reasoning-critic", "reasoning"),
    CriticAgent("tool-critic", "tool_use"),
    CriticAgent("policy-critic", "policy"),
])
```

Each critic evaluates independently. Their feedback is aggregated using:
- **Weighted Average**: Confidence-weighted scores
- **Voting**: Majority vote on thresholds
- **Debate**: Highest-confidence critic wins
- **Consensus**: Accept only high-agreement feedback

### üîÑ Algorithm-Agnostic Design

RLAF works with **any RL algorithm**:

```python
# Use ARPO
config = TrainingConfig(algorithm="arpo", entropy_threshold=0.8)

# Or GRPO-TCR
config = TrainingConfig(algorithm="grpo-tcr", tool_call_reasoning=True)

# Or standard PPO/DPO
config = TrainingConfig(algorithm="ppo")
```

### üè≠ Production-Ready

Not just research. Built for real applications:

```python
# ITSM Agent
actor = ActorAgent(name="itsm-triage", ...)
critics = CriticEnsemble([
    CriticAgent("accuracy", "accuracy"),
    CriticAgent("sla", "policy"),
    CriticAgent("speed", "speed"),
])

# Code Generation Agent
actor = ActorAgent(name="code-gen", ...)
critics = CriticEnsemble([
    CriticAgent("correctness", "accuracy"),
    CriticAgent("quality", "code_quality"),
    CriticAgent("efficiency", "speed"),
])
```

---

## Real-World Example: ITSM Triage Agent

Let's train an IT incident triage agent:

```python
import asyncio
from rlaf import RLAFTrainer
from rlaf.agents import ActorAgent, CriticAgent, CriticEnsemble
from rlaf.core.trainer import TrainingConfig

async def train_itsm_agent():
    # 1. Create actor (ITSM triage agent)
    actor = ActorAgent(
        name="itsm-triage",
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        system_prompt="You triage IT incidents...",
        api_key="your-api-key"
    )

    # 2. Create multi-critic ensemble
    critics = CriticEnsemble([
        CriticAgent("accuracy", "accuracy", api_key="your-api-key"),
        CriticAgent("policy", "policy", api_key="your-api-key"),
        CriticAgent("speed", "speed", api_key="your-api-key"),
    ])

    # 3. Configure ARPO training
    config = TrainingConfig(
        algorithm="arpo",
        entropy_threshold=0.8,
        adaptive_rollout=True,
        reward_aggregation="weighted_average"
    )

    # 4. Train with incident data
    trainer = RLAFTrainer(actor=actor, critics=critics, config=config)

    dataset = [
        {"incident": "Email down", "priority": 3, ...},
        {"incident": "Production DB crash", "priority": 1, ...},
        # ... more incidents
    ]

    results = await trainer.train(dataset)
    return results

asyncio.run(train_itsm_agent())
```

**What happens:**
1. Actor triages incident ‚Üí suggests team & priority
2. Accuracy critic evaluates: "Is assignment correct?"
3. Policy critic evaluates: "Does it follow SLA?"
4. Speed critic evaluates: "Is it fast enough?"
5. Feedbacks aggregated ‚Üí reward signal
6. ARPO updates policy (with adaptive rollout if uncertain)

## The Multi-Critic Feedback Flow

```
Input Incident: "Production DB down"
    ‚Üì
[Actor] ‚Üí "Priority 1, assign to Database Team"
    ‚Üì
[Critics Evaluate]
    ‚îú‚îÄ Accuracy: score=0.95 (correct assignment)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Policy: score=0.85 (meets SLA)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Speed: score=0.70 (slow response)
    ‚Üì
[Feedback Collector] ‚Üí weighted_avg = 0.83
    ‚Üì
[Reward Aggregator] ‚Üí reward = 0.83 + bonuses - penalties
    ‚Üì
[ARPO Algorithm] ‚Üí update policy
    ‚Üì
Next iteration (with improved policy)
```

## How RLAF Complements Existing Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | RLAF Integration |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **Open-AgentRL** | GRPO-TCR algorithm, tool reasoning | Use GRPO-TCR within RLAF trainer |
| **ARPO** | Adaptive rollout, entropy-based exploration | Use ARPO with multi-critic entropy |
| **KAT-Dev** | Multi-stage training pipeline | Use KAT stages with critic ensemble |
| **IBM Multi-Agent** | Orchestration, cooperative learning | Add RLAF for feedback-driven training |

**RLAF doesn't replace these frameworks‚Äîit enhances them** with structured, multi-perspective feedback.

---

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Richer Reward Signals**
Single reward: `0.75`
Multi-critic: `{accuracy: 0.9, policy: 0.6, speed: 0.8}`

### 2. **Interpretable Feedback**
Each critic provides reasoning and suggestions:
```python
Feedback(
    critic="policy",
    score=0.6,
    reasoning="SLA risk: response time > 2min",
    suggestions=["Optimize query", "Add caching"],
    confidence=0.9
)
```

### 3. **Cross-Domain Applicability**
- ‚úÖ ITSM (triage, resolution)
- ‚úÖ Code generation (quality, correctness)
- ‚úÖ Reasoning tasks (math, logic)
- ‚úÖ Chatbots (helpfulness, safety)

### 4. **Production-Ready**
- Model-agnostic (Claude, GPT, Qwen, Llama)
- Configurable aggregation strategies
- Structured feedback schema
- Easy integration with existing systems

## Getting Started (30 seconds)

```bash
pip install rlaf
```

```python
import asyncio
from rlaf import RLAFTrainer
from rlaf.agents import ActorAgent, CriticEnsemble, CriticAgent
from rlaf.core.trainer import TrainingConfig

async def main():
    actor = ActorAgent(name="agent", model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
    critics = CriticEnsemble([
        CriticAgent("accuracy", "accuracy"),
        CriticAgent("reasoning", "reasoning"),
    ])
    config = TrainingConfig(algorithm="arpo", max_iterations=10)

    trainer = RLAFTrainer(actor=actor, critics=critics, config=config)
    results = await trainer.train(your_dataset)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## The Road Ahead

**Immediate:**
- Benchmark suite (RLAF vs Open-AgentRL vs ARPO)
- More domain examples (healthcare, finance, customer service)
- Integration with Hugging Face TRL

**Future:**
- Self-improving critics (critics learn from actor performance)
- Hierarchical critic ensembles (meta-critics)
- Federated multi-agent training
- Critic marketplace (community-contributed perspectives)

---

## Why This Matters

AI agents are everywhere:
- Customer service bots
- Code assistants
- IT automation
- Healthcare diagnosis
- Financial analysis

But they're trained with **simplistic reward signals**. RLAF changes that.

**Multi-perspective feedback = Smarter agents.**
