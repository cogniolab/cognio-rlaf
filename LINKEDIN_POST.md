# LinkedIn Post: RLAF Framework Launch

## 🚀 Introducing RLAF: The Missing Piece in Multi-Agent AI Systems

I'm excited to share **RLAF (Reinforcement Learning from Agentic Feedback)** - an open-source framework that changes how we train AI agents.

🔗 **GitHub:** https://github.com/cogniolab/cognio-rlaf

### The Problem

Traditional RL uses single scalar rewards:
```
reward = 0.75
```

But what does 0.75 mean? Is the response fast but incorrect? Accurate but slow? We can't tell.

### The Solution: Multi-Perspective Critic Ensembles

RLAF uses **multiple specialized critics**, each evaluating from a different perspective:

```python
feedbacks = [
    Feedback(critic="accuracy", score=0.9, reasoning="Correct answer"),
    Feedback(critic="policy", score=0.6, reasoning="SLA risk"),
    Feedback(critic="speed", score=0.8, reasoning="Could be faster"),
]
# Aggregated: 0.77 with rich diagnostic context
```

### What Makes RLAF Unique?

🎭 **Multi-Perspective Evaluation**
- 7 built-in perspectives: accuracy, reasoning, tool use, code quality, policy, speed, safety
- Custom perspectives for your domain

🔄 **Algorithm-Agnostic**
- ARPO (Adaptive Reinforcement Policy Optimization)
- GRPO-TCR (from Open-AgentRL)
- PPO, DPO

🏭 **Production-Ready**
- Not just research - built for real applications
- Works with Claude, GPT, Qwen, Llama
- Cross-domain: ITSM, code generation, reasoning, chatbots

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

RLAF builds on three major 2025 breakthroughs:

1️⃣ **ARPO** (July 2025) - Entropy-based adaptive rollout
2️⃣ **Open-AgentRL** (Oct 13, 2025) - Tool-call reasoning (4B model beats 32B!)
3️⃣ **KAT-Dev** (Sept 2025) - Multi-stage training (62.4% SWE-Bench)

We don't replace these frameworks - we **enhance them** with structured multi-perspective feedback.

### Quick Start (30 seconds)

```python
from rlaf import RLAFTrainer
from rlaf.agents import ActorAgent, CriticEnsemble, CriticAgent

# Create actor
actor = ActorAgent(name="agent", model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")

# Create critics
critics = CriticEnsemble([
    CriticAgent("accuracy", "accuracy"),
    CriticAgent("reasoning", "reasoning"),
])

# Train!
trainer = RLAFTrainer(actor=actor, critics=critics, config=config)
results = await trainer.train(your_dataset)
```

### Real-World Examples Included

✅ **ITSM Triage Agent** - Accuracy, policy compliance, speed critics
✅ **Code Generation** - Correctness, quality, efficiency critics
✅ **Simple Demo** - Minimal working example

### Why This Matters

AI agents are everywhere:
- Customer service bots
- Code assistants
- IT automation
- Healthcare diagnosis

But they're trained with **simplistic reward signals**. RLAF changes that.

**Multi-perspective feedback = Smarter agents.**

## Alternative Shorter Version (if character limit is an issue)

---

🚀 Just released RLAF - an open-source framework for training AI agents with multi-perspective feedback!

**The Problem:** Traditional RL uses single rewards (0.75 - but what does that mean?)

**The Solution:** Multiple specialized critics evaluate from different perspectives:
- ✅ Accuracy
- ✅ Reasoning
- ✅ Tool Use
- ✅ Code Quality
- ✅ Policy Compliance

**Built on 2025 SOTA:**
- ARPO (adaptive rollout)
- Open-AgentRL (tool reasoning)
- KAT-Dev (multi-stage training)

**Features:**
🎭 7 built-in critic perspectives
🔄 4 RL algorithms (ARPO, GRPO-TCR, PPO, DPO)
🏭 Production-ready examples
🌐 Cross-domain (ITSM, code gen, chatbots)

📦 GitHub: https://github.com/cogniolab/cognio-rlaf
📚 Full docs & examples included

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/cogniolab/cognio-rlaf.git
```
