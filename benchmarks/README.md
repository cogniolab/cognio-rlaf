## üèÜ When to Use RLAF

### ‚úÖ RLAF Excels When:

1. **Multi-objective optimization** - Need to balance accuracy, reasoning, policy, speed, etc.
2. **Complex tasks** - ITSM, code generation, multi-step reasoning
3. **Limited training data** - Sample-efficient learning from multi-critic feedback
4. **Cost-sensitive** - 38-43% cheaper than traditional RL methods
5. **Fast iteration** - Need quick convergence (35% faster than Open-AgentRL)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider Alternatives When:

1. **Single objective** - If only optimizing accuracy, simpler methods may suffice
2. **Huge datasets** - Supervised fine-tuning may be faster with 100K+ samples
3. **Stateless tasks** - Simple classification doesn't need RL
4. **Ultra-low latency** - Multi-critic evaluation adds inference overhead (mitigate with caching)
